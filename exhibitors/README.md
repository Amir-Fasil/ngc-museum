# Exhibitors

## Directions on Formatting

In this directory, scientific and engineered models and projects using ngc-learn
are grouped based on the scientist or research team that invented them and is
responsible for maintaining their respective grouping. In effect, sub-directories
here contain sets of exhibits that one exhibitor maintains and releases to the
public.

The contents of each exhibitor sub-directory may be organized and structured
however the exhibitor requires, though it is recommended that each sub-directory
within an exhibitor's folder pertains to a single paper/publication or
application. The only file we require in an exhibitor's folder is a single
markdown file -- `README.md` -- containing information about the exhibitor and a
header containing the name of the exhibitor, e.g., the researcher, organization,
company, or research group/lab, as follows:
```markdown
# <NAME_OF_EXHIBITOR>

...rest of text...
```
